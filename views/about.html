            <p>Son Gohan (孫そん悟ご飯はん Son Gohan) is a half-breed Saiyan and one of the most prominent characters in the Dragon Ball series. He is the elder son of the series' primary protagonist Goku and his wife Chi-Chi, the eldest nephew of Raditz, the older brother of Goten, the husband of Videl and father to Pan. He is named after Goku's adoptive grandfather, Gohan</p>
            <p>Unlike his father, Gohan lacks a passion for fighting (although, he does possess a strong power within him) and prefers to do so only when his loved ones are threatened. Nevertheless, Gohan fights alongside the Dragon Team in the defense of Earth for much of his life.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <em>Gohan resembles his father, inheriting Goku's hair, facial features, and dark eyes. At the same time, he has his mother's light peach complexion rather than his father's light tan. Also taking after his father, Gohan inherited a Saiyan tail, which was long and prehensile with brown fur. It was removed and regrew a few times during his childhood until removed permanently by Vegeta in their first battle.</em>

                <p>When first introduced as a young child, he had short and spiky but relatively well-kept hair. He wore a white sleeveless shirt and green pants with black boots with white lacing, this outfit was covered in a Hanfu-style top that was yellow with green sleeves and on the front his family name, 'Son', written in kanji within a large white circle with black lining. He also wore a red cap with the Four-Star Dragon Ball attached to the top. He later removes the Hanfu-style top to show his outfit when he is ready to train with Piccolo.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Gohan was born in May 18 of Age 757, about a year after Goku and Chi-Chi married following the conclusion of the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament.</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>While training with Piccolo, after losing his previous outfit from transforming into a Great Ape, he wears an outfit similar to Goku's original, consisting of an orange gi and black belt with a black undershirt, blue wristbands, and black boots with yellow lasing. In the Anime, his uniform is the same as Piccolo's consisting of a purple gi with a red sash and armbands, bronze grass shoes, and a white collar around his neck. At the same time, he wore with the 'Ma' symbol (魔) and his hair grew out more into a mullet-style that reached his shoulders. By the fight against the Saiyans, Gohan grows noticeably more muscular for a child and dons a similar attire to the Namekian warriors. He also sported a white bandana. Gohan's hair has been cut short and has three thick fringes on his head. Before going to Namek with Krillin and Bulma, Gohan is initially seen wearing an outfit worn in private elementary school and later his Namekian outfit. During his battle against Frieza, Vegeta gave Gohan a Battle Armor, which consisted of a blue jumpsuit with white gloves and boots, and a white torso protection with yellow shoulder pads.</p>
                <p>During the Androids Saga, his hair grew even longer, reaching his thighs, and his Namekian outfit was modified to include black kung-fu shoes and white shins. While training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, he wore a similar Battle Armor from Planet Namek, which lacked shoulder pads. After leaving the Time Chamber, he grows noticeably taller (roughly Krillin's height), and also quite muscularly developed for his age. He reverts to Piccolo's clothing for the Cell Games, with the addition of Piccolo's white cape and weighted shoulder pads. During this time his hair is spiky much like Goku's. Gohan's outfit in Bojack Unbound which looks exactly like the one Goku wore in the Androids Saga and Majin Buu Saga.</p>

                    <p>As a young adult, he becomes similar in height to his father. His hair is much shorter and stands on end in a spiky formation, with a single bang hanging over the right side of his forehead. Having slacked off in training, he looks noticeably skinnier and leaner in frame, though still respectfully muscular. Also similar to his father, Gohan is noted as being very attractive by many females such as Erasa and Angela. He alternates between a school uniform, his Great Saiyaman costume, and a blue gi similar to the Piccolo clothing. While wearing his blue gi, his obi, wrist bands and shin guards are red but in Dragon Ball Z: Broly - Second Coming, the shin guards are reverted to white. During the Buu Saga, he wears Kai clothing given to him by Kibito. In his fight against Super Buu and reuniting with his father and Vegeta after they defeated Kid Buu, Gohan wears an outfit identical to his father. At the party for the celebration of the defeat of Kid Buu, he wears a blue suit as part of his formal clothing.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>As an adult in the end of Dragon Ball Z, Gohan's hair would be similar to how it was in the Buu Arc minus the bang which resembles Yamcha's hairstyle from the Androids Saga. In Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, Gohan's wears glasses, a blue vest with a long white undershirt, and brown slacks with black shoes.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’/Dragon Ball Super, having since retired from fighting completely and slacked off in his training, Gohan became very scrawny in build. His hair is also smoother and much flatter. Gohan tends to wear formal clothing as he studies to become a professor consisting of a grey collar shirt with a blue vest and red pants. On Frieza's arrival on Earth, he wears a green tracksuit because he forgot where his gi was. After he resumes training with Piccolo, Gohan slicks up his hair again to have spiky ends. By the time of the Tournament of Power, Gohan's training with Piccolo reconditioned his body, becoming basically as muscular as Goku. When battling, he would slick his hair back up again and removes his glasses. Also for the tournament, in the anime Gohan dons the same style gi he wore against Super Buu, while in the manga he dons a gi virtually identical to what he wore at the Cell Games, minus the white cape and shoulder pads.</p>

                <ul><li><em>In the upcoming movie, Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero, Gohan reverts back to wearing the Piccolo clothing with the white cape and shoulder pads and also wearing eyeglasses. He can also remove the white cape, shoulder pads and eyeglasses if the battle becomes tricky.</em></li></ul>
                <p>In Dragon Ball GT, he retains his hairstyle from the end of Dragon Ball Z with the only difference being it is a little longer and is fully swept up, not having any hanging bangs. He is usually seen dressed like a professor or a businessman, in a suit and a tie. He also wears eyeglasses, though he apparently only needs them for reading, due to the fact that he showed no impairment without them for battle. When facing Syn Shenron, Gohan wears a gi resembling that of the ones Goku used to wear throughout Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super.</p>
                   <ul><li><em>In the Assault on the Hell Gate Saga, GT Gohan wears a gi identical to Piccolo's, though without the cape and turban.</em></li></ul>
